## Project Overview

This repository contains three projects from the **Optimization** course, each focusing on different optimization techniques using MATLAB.

### Project 1: Single Variable Function Optimization
- Implemented various algorithms to minimize concave functions of a single variable.
- Methods used:
  - Bisection Method
  - Golden Section Method
  - Fibonacci Method
  - Bisection Method using Derivative

### Project 2: Derivative Methods
- Focused on minimization using methods based on derivatives.
- Implemented the following algorithms:
  - Steepest Descent Method
  - Newton's Method
  - Levenberg-Marquardt Method

### Project 3: Projected Steepest Descent
- Implemented and compared the Projected Steepest Descent method with the classic Steepest Descent method.
- Minimized a convex objective function with constraints and explored different parameter values.

## Results

- **Project 1:** Successfully minimized various functions using different single-variable optimization methods. Each method's performance was compared based on iterations and function evaluations.
- **Project 2:** Demonstrated the application of derivative-based methods, with a focus on convergence and performance across different initial conditions.
- **Project 3:** Achieved effective results using the Projected Steepest Descent method, with detailed analysis on parameter influence and convergence behavior.
